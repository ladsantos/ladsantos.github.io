In these conditions, hot and thick atmospheres literally boil off to space, and can dramatically alter the appearance and composition of the planet.

Among my discoveries, I found that the temperate mini-Neptune K2-18 b displays a signature of a large hydrogen exosphere around it, possibly fed by atmospheric escape.\nEvolution of exoplanets The most common types of planets we have found so far are what we call super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. As their names imply, these are worlds whose sizes vary between that of Neptune and the Earth. Since we do not have any examples of this type of planet in the Solar System, the nature of these worlds is a mystery.\nWe believe these planets are prone to losing a significant part of their atmospheres, causing them to “evaporate” and shrink as they age. This evolution is one of the most exciting areas of research in exoplanetary science. I am interested in observing and modeling the process of evaporation. Among my publications, I have shown that the warm Neptune-sized planet HAT-P-11 b is stable against photoevaporation.\nSpectroscopy techniques I have been doing astronomical spectroscopy since 2013, it is my bread and butter. I am particularly interested in spectral time series, spectral extraction, and transmission spectroscopy of exoplanetary atmospheres. Nowadays, I mostly use the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes in my research, but I have also experience with ground-based, high-resolution spectrographs, such as ESO/HARPS and Keck/NIRSPEC. In the future, I am looking forward to exploring atmospheres of other worlds using the ELT-class telescopes and the Habitable Worlds Observatory.\nSolar twins I studied the Sun and solar twins mostly during my Master’s. My project focused on their rotational evolution, and how that ties into other planetary systems similar to the Solar System. I am still involved with research projects on this subject, particularly on high-precision spectroscopy using ground-based spectrographs.\nTeam At STScI, I lead the Terra Research Group, which seeks to understand the evolution of exoplanet atmospheres through photoevaporation and interactions with their host stars.\nLead\nDr. Leonardo Dos Santos Current members\nLakeisha M.
