I am an Assistant Astronomer at the [Space Telescope Science Institute](https://www.stsci.edu) working with the [COS instrument](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/cos) team of the *Hubble Space Telescope*. I was born and raised in Brazil and my pronouns are he/him/his üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà.

My main research topic is the [characterization of extra-solar planets and their atmospheres](research). I am also interested in stellar atmospheres and developing scientific software for the astronomical community. The main instruments I use in my research are high-resolution and/or space-based spectrographs.

Occasionally I [write software](https://github.com/ladsantos) in Python and scripts for astronomical research. Here are some that I think could be useful for you:

* [`p-winds`](https://p-winds.readthedocs.io/): Isothermal Parker wind models for upper atmospheres of planets. Feel free to [create a pull request](https://github.com/ladsantos/p-winds/pulls) or [submit issues](https://github.com/ladsantos/p-winds/issues) on GitHub!

* [`stissplice`](https://github.com/ladsantos/stissplice): Splice echelle spectra from STIS.

* [`flatstar`](https://github.com/ladsantos/flatstar): Draw (exo)planetary transits.

* [`sunburn`](https://github.com/ladsantos/sunburn): Data analysis package of HST far-UV spectra.
