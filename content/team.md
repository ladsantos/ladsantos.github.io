Members of the Terra team are also part of the broader [Transiting Exoplanet Research Group](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/research-groups/transiting-exoplanets-group) at STScI, a large collaboration focused on understanding the atmospheres of exoplanets through transmission spectroscopy techniques.
